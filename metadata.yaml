description: The second installment in the thrilling adventures of the Lone Wolf A
  muddy figure inches his way across no man&rsquo;s land, the only living thing in
  a hellscape of death and misery. Artillery lights up the night sky and he pauses&mdash;as
  stiff and motionless as the corpses that block his path. Darkness returns, and he
  sprints to safety, tumbling down a ladder into the British trenches. He is no ordinary
  soldier returned from a nighttime mission. He is the Lone Wolf, master jewel thief,
  and he has been hunting his prey for years. When last we saw Michael Lanyard, he
  had turned his back on crime and was ready to start life anew, the beautiful Lucy
  Shannon at his side. But the reputation of a world-class thief always precedes him,
  and Lanyard&rsquo;s young family has been denied a home in America, England, and
  France. In Belgium, they thought they had found peace&mdash;until the invading German
  army brought a ruthless villain to their door. Alone again, Lanyard dedicates himself
  to vengeance, tracking his archnemesis across every battlefield in Europe. Herr
  Ekstrom is bound for New York, and the Lone Wolf will brave torpedoes, secret agents,
  and impressionable young women to exact his righteous revenge. This ebook features
  a new introduction by Otto Penzler and has been professionally proofread to ensure
  accuracy and readability on all devices.
